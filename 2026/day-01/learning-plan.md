90DaysofDevops Learning Plan- Akshada Burambadkar

Current level: 7 years of experience in support Paas(kubernetes)

What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
I have 7 years of experience in support and the recent one is working on PaaS-Kubernetes clusters. Through out these years, I have also been exposed to AWS and Azure clouds so I have a fair understanding of cloud engineering. However, I had no understanding of DevOps until today.

Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
I have always struggled to understand full picture of how things work as a whole and this curiosity bought me to learning DevOps.

Where do you want to reach?
I want to reach a point where I have complete understanding about lifecycle of application deployment, work on challenging problems and be the best problem solver.

How you will stay consistent every single day?
I believe in having balance to achieve/sustain any long term goal. I am not working at the current moment hence I will commit 4 to 6 hrs daily until I become interview ready.
